Wagyu is a general library for the following basic geometric operations:

* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* XOR

The output geometry from each of these operations is guaranteed to be [valid and simple as per the OGC](http://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#OGC_Validity).

## Documentation

Documentation of any library is critical to its existance and it really takes a community of effort. All of the documentation for the library is [included with the library](https://github.com/mapbox/wagyu/blob/master/docs/README.md). The Wagyu project loves pull requests so please feel free to contribute at any point in time to the `docs/` directory in any way you see fit! If you see a problem in documentation, at least please make an issue in the github repository.
